    Creating a BAD First Impression 
    <br>
    Sloppy Language: No matter how well you dress, using sloppy language will lessen your
credibility with others. For example saying "yeah" instead of "yes", or using profanity,
especially around people that would not find it impressive. Most people consider your choice of
words a direct reflection on your intelligence. 
    <br>
    Giggling: While laughter can be the best medicine for many ills, giggling can be annoying
    <br>
    Hiding your Hands: Believe it or not, etiquette research has shown that hands above board are
more appealing than hands hidden away in pockets. When your hands are not showing, it often
sends a signal to someone that you are not telling all or that you are holding something back
    <br>
    o Gum-Chewing: Let there be no doubt about it, you should not chew gum when meeting people.
No exceptions.
<br>
    o Throat Clearing: The habit of clearing your throat several times during a conversation can be
very distracting.
